<strong>Update, June 2016:</strong> 
GitHub recently announced <a href="https://github.com/blog/2186-https-for-github-pages">official HTTPS support for github.io domains</a> on GitHub Pages!
<br/><br/>
This is <em>excellent</em> progress, especially because <strong>for new github.io sites, HTTPS is mandatory</strong>. Existing github.io sites can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/">opt-in to server-side HTTPS enforcement</a>.
<br/><br/>
Of course, the work's not done until GitHub Pages supports HTTPS for custom domains. GitHub hosts a huge number of project, personal, and conference sites that use custom domains -- including <a href="http://codeconf.com">GitHub's own CodeConf site</a> -- which all continue to put their users at risk.
<br/><br/>
But this is hugely promising, and clearly involved a ton of CDN and infrastructure work by GitHub that will make custom domain HTTPS support easier. It also means that the GitHub Pages team made HTTPS support a priority for its finite engineering time, and that bodes well too.
<br/><br/>
I've updated some instructions below to reflect GitHub's new options. You can also <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156">follow this long-running GitHub Issues thread</a> for community updates on further developments.

Recently, GitHub Pages [began supporting HTTPS](https://twitter.com/benbalter/status/444555263195217920) for `*.github.io` domains, like [this one](https://cfpb.github.io/) and [this one](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/). 

In my opinion, this is a huge deal - GitHub Pages is the only major, free, general-purpose web host which also offers a secure channel. Given [how many simple and powerful uses](https://konklone.com/post/the-power-and-potential-of-github-pages) GitHub Pages has, and how vital secure and confidential connections are to the future of the web, I see this as a big step forward for developers, GitHub, and everyday people.

There are two major catches:

* You **can't force HTTPS** for your `*.github.io` site.
* You **can't use a custom domain name** with a fully secured HTTPS connection.

But you **can** use an `https://yourname.github.io` URL. So let's work with what we've got!

### Defaulting to HTTPS

If you have a GitHub Pages site, and you'd like it to run as close to HTTPS-only as possible:

* Always link to your own site using its `https://` URL. Go through any supporting sites or blog posts or material and update the link.
* If there are any external and prominent links to your site, ask the site owner to update their link to use `https://`.
* If you're a go-getter, do a GitHub search for [anyone linking to your domain](https://github.com/search?q=%22sunlightlabs.github.io%22&ref=cmdform&type=Code), and file some quick in-browser PRs to switch people's links.

### Telling search engines

Use **[canonical URLs](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en)** to tell search engines to use the HTTPS version of your website.

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://yoursite.github.io" />
```

In Jekyll, this looks like:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}" />
```

Where you've set the `url` field in your site's `_config.yml` file. See [here](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/b58cbcd66d2535746bfa43d42f670b9b1c105fd3/_config.yml#L26) and [here](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/b58cbcd66d2535746bfa43d42f670b9b1c105fd3/_includes/head.html#L27) for an example.

### Forcing a redirect

So, how do you force a redirect for a static site when you don't control the server? You can't use a `<meta refresh>` tag, because you can't change what HTML gets delivered per-protocol.

The only choice is to **do it in JavaScript**. Put the following at the top of your HTML, replacing `YOURDOMAIN` with your user or organization name:

```javascript
var host = "YOURDOMAIN.github.io";
if ((host == window.location.host) && (window.location.protocol != "https:"))
    window.location.protocol = "https";
```

The above hack will immediately redirect any users who visit your domain on an insecure protocol to a secure protocol. It won't affect visitors on any other domain (like `localhost`). This is what we're doing at the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com) now for the documentation for our [Sunlight Congress API](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/).

Make no mistake, client-side redirecting is a hack and an imperfect solution by any means. It's also not secure! But the whole point is to make sure that the links other people make to your website going *forward* are the secure kind. The more links that you and others make that go directly to `https://`, the less often the redirect will need to be triggered.

If you're using Jekyll, you may wish to [follow my example](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/congress/commit/6426761a671d46df6fc5d2526bdaf506c39d789c) of using a `site.enforce_ssl` parameter, or you can just hardcode it like above. It'd be nicer if this could get baked into a Jekyll plugin, but GitHub Pages only supports a couple of whitelisted plugins. 

### Using a custom domain with CloudFlare

[**Update**: Rewrote this section later in 2014, after CloudFlare released their free SSL plan.]

[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) now offers **[free SSL termination](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/)** for any website they host, under their "Universal SSL" plan. 

There are a couple of caveats:

* The free plan uses only modern technical standards ([ECDSA](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/), [SHA-2](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/09/gradually-sunsetting-sha-1.html), [SNI](https://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/05/09/if_you_can_read_this_youre_sniing)), so customers visiting using Windows XP and/or old Internet Explorer browsers may not be able to connect.
* Until GitHub Pages or CloudFlare fix things, you'll only be able to encrypt the connection between the user and CloudFlare. The connection between CloudFlare and GitHub Pages will need to remain in plaintext, using CloudFlare's "Flexible SSL" option. For more information on why this is the case, read [these](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156#issuecomment-57271637) [comments](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156#issuecomment-60453315) that lay out how it works.

If you're okay not supporting ancient clients, and with traffic flowing in clear text between CloudFlare and GitHub, you can turn on SSL for free in front of your GitHub Pages site with a custom domain.

But **be careful**. This is a tempting, but incomplete solution. I was [very disappointed](https://github.com/MayOneUS/homepage_redesign/issues/82) to see the [MayDay SuperPAC](https://mayday.us) use this configuration to solicit donations. An attacker who could get between CloudFlare and GitHub could have altered the form in transit to send payment information to anywhere they wanted.

More generally problematic is that the browser has no way of indicating to the user that the connection is not fully secure. Right now, people generally expect that if there's a lock symbol in the browser, the connection is secure between them and the website. CloudFlare's Flexible SSL configuration breaks this expectation, and there is no way from the outside to tell whether a website is using it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Gotta say, I agree with <a href="https://twitter.com/__agwa">@__agwa</a> - CloudFlare has good intentions, but their Flexible SSL dilutes the value of HTTPS: <a href="https://t.co/6B3dqMzHgK">https://t.co/6B3dqMzHgK</a></p>â€” Eric Mill (@konklone) <a href="https://twitter.com/konklone/status/539543267311091715">December 1, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I'm not saying to never use CloudFlare's Flexible SSL - but know exactly what you are doing, and communicate to CloudFlare that they need to [add a way for outsiders to know how secure the connection is](https://twitter.com/ivanristic/status/530761077001162753).

### What GitHub can do

It's unlikely that GitHub is going to create the infrastructure needed to natively support custom domains, and Cloudflare's leadership will render that less of a problem. 

However, there are still a few things GitHub can do to lower the barrier to using HTTPS and to make people more aware of it.

* **Document the feature.** There's no formal announcement or description of SSL for GitHub Pages; it could disappear any time. It's worth a quick blog post and a help page, to cement GitHub's commitment and describe how to avoid common mixed content pitfalls.
* **Allow SSL for custom domains configured elsewhere.** As mentioned above, even if you configure your custom domain with a service like CloudFlare and point a CNAME at GitHub Pages, you'll get an error, and one that requires action on GitHub's part to fix.
* **Shore up the SSL configuration.** `github.com`'s SSL is [world-class](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=github.com&s=192.30.252.128&hideResults=on), but `github.io`'s could still [use some tweaks](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=sunlightlabs.github.io) around forward secrecy and cipher choices.
* Most importantly, **let users turn HTTPS on by default**, with a checkbox in their settings that forces a redirect at the server level. That would render the entire hack above unnecessary, and lead a lot more people to Just Do It. In fact, turn on the checkbox by default for new users, and for existing users who don't yet have any GitHub Pages!

2014 may well be the Year of SSL, and GitHub is fertile ground for expanding the playing field. If you want to push this forward, email [support@github.com](mailto:support@github.com) and ask for formal HTTPS support in GitHub Pages. (Referencing this blog post can't hurt.)

In the meantime, I've been going around [filing PRs](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/pull/295) and [opening tickets](https://github.com/cfpb/cfpb.github.io/issues/22) with GitHub Pages sites I care about, to squash mixed-content warnings and ensure they're HTTPS-ready. Go adopt some sites you know on GitHub Pages and do the same!
